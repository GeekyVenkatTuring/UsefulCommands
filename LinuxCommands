chown-
In Linux,all files are associated with owner and group.
The chown command is used to change the user and group ownership of the given file

To get the root user for that machine,please use the below command:
$USER

to change the ownership of the file:
sudo chown -R $USER <file path>

in above command -R used for recursive and in some commands we use -r for recursive
Both -R and -r are valid


Set title to the Linux gnome-terminal:
Please edit the bashrc file(cd ~/.bashrc) and add the below code snippet in the file
set-title(){
  ORIG=$PS1
  TITLE="\e]2;$@\a"
  PS1=${ORIG}${TITLE}
