//Installing MongoDB

Mongo db is part of open tool repositories in the ubuntu,so we can download directly from apt-get commands

sudo apt-get install mongodb
sudo apt-get update---this will provide the latest version

Default port is used by mongodb while installing is 27017

To find mongodb is installed or not ,please use below commands
mongod --version
mongo --version

2.Start the MongoDB service
sudo service mongodb start


working MongoDB shell
1.Run below command to get into mongodb shell
mongo
2.To check default database in the mongodb
show dbs;
3.create custom/own database
use mydb;
4.Print the current database
db;
5.Print the collection in the db
show collections;
6.Print documents in the collection
db.mycol.find();


MongoDb compass is the GUI for mongodb server
Installing mongodb compass
wget https://downloads.mongodb.com/compass/mongodb-compass_1.15.1_amd64.deb;
sudo dpkg -i mongodb-compass_1.15.1_amd64.deb;
mongodb-compass;

Setting authentication in the MongoDB:
1.start the mongod instance which is background process used for accepting requests(see Miscellaneous section for more details)
start MongoDB instance with out access control
mongod --port 27017 --dbpath /data/db1
2.start mongo shell
mongo --port 27017
3.create the user administrator with userAdminAnyDatabase role
use admin --switch to admin database
db.createUser(
	{
		user: "xxxxxxxxx",
		pwd:"xxxxxxxxxxx",
		roles: [ { role: "userAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin" }, "readWriteAnyDatabase" ]
	}

)
4.Restart MongoDB instance with access control
mongod --auth --port 27017 --dbpath <to check the db path ,please check the /etc/mongodb.config>
In my machine,the default path is /var/lib/path
This will start running and will manage the mongodb server
Sometimes,if you see below error in starting the server,please clean the diagnostic folder(rm -f /var/lib/mongodb/diagnostic.data/*)


2019-03-05T20:47:04.482+0530 I FTDC     [initandlisten] Initializing full-time diagnostic data capture with directory '/var/lib/mongodb/diagnostic.data'
2019-03-05T20:47:04.482+0530 I NETWORK  [initandlisten] waiting for connections on port 27071
2019-03-05T20:47:05.008+0530 I FTDC     [ftdc] Unclean full-time diagnostic data capture shutdown detected, found interim file, some metrics may have been lost.Ok


5.Now open another terminal,run 
mongo --port 27017 -u <xxxxx> -p <xxxxx> --authenticationDatabase "admin"
After running these commands, in the mongodb server terminal ,you may notice below errors

a.Unauthorized: not authorized on admin to execute command { replSetGetStatus: 1.0, forShell: 1.0, $db: "admin" }
For this error, we need grant below role to the user
db.grantRolesToUser(    XXXXXX ,    [ "clusterManager" ] )


b.Unauthorized: not authorized on admin to execute command { getLog: "startupWarnings", $db: "admin" }
db.updateUser(
... ... XXXXXX,
... ... {
... ... roles 
... ... :[{role:"root",db:"admin"}]});
or you can use db.grantRolesToUser(XXXXX,"admin");

c.If you want to check the users and their roles for that database,use below commands
use <db>---this will get into that db session
db.getUser("<user name>");








Few points to remember:
1.if you want to create collection or document,use below command
db.mycol.insert({"name":"Mark"});
2.If you want to check the db path for mongodb ,please use the below config file from below mentioned path
/etc/mongod.config








miscellaneous Concepts:

1.Difference between MongoD and Mongo:
MongoD:
It stands for Mongo Daemon
Lets first understand what is daemon:
A daemon (pronounced DEE-muhn) is a program that runs continuously and exists for the purpose of handling periodic service requests that a computer system expects to receive. The daemon program forwards the requests to other programs (or processes) as appropriate. Each server of pages on the Web has an HTTPD or Hypertext Transfer Protocol daemon that continually waits for requests to come in from Web clients and their users.

Here Mongo daemon is background process used by Mongod server to get things done
This process is responsible for managing the whole MongoDB server tasks such as accepting requests, responding to users, managing memory requirement of MongoDB server operations and other things essential for MongoDB Server to run.

Mongo:
Mongo is an interactive JavaScript shell interface to MongoDB, which provides a powerful interface for system administrators as well as a way for developers to test queries and operations directly with the database. mongo also provides a fully functional JavaScript environment for use with a MongoDB
