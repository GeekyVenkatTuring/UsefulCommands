Git commands:

Step 1:install git in local machine
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
git --version

Step2:
Create Github account
username-mvramaiah1992@gmail.com
pwd-*************

Create repository with  name "UsefulCommands"
https://github.com/GeekyVenkatTuring/UsefulCommands.git

Step3:Connect Github with local git
Create folder "UsefulCommands" in /home/vishvaksen/git/
Open Terminal and run below commands


1.cd /home/vishvaksen/git/UsefulCommands
2.git init
3.Connect Github repository to git
git remote add origin "https://github.com/GeekyVenkatTuring/UsefulCommands.git"
4.Pull master branch with files into local git repository
git pull origin master
5.Create new file in the local repository
mkdir GitCommands.txt
6.Add this file to the stageing area or index so that we can commit these changes
git add GitCommands
7.To check if this file is added in the Staging or not,use below command
git status
8.Now use commit command to push it to the local repository and while committing we need to provide message
git commit -m "First Commit for Git Commands"



other useful commands:
1.If you want to commit all the files in the folder,use below command to add it to the staging area
git add -A
git commit -a

2.if you want to check complete logs of all the commits,use below command
git log

Create local branches other than master branch:
1.git branch <name of the branch>
2.TO switch from master branch to local branch
git checkout <name of the branch>
3.TO merge local branch to master branch
a.switch out to master
git checkout master
b.merge the local branch
git merge <name of the branch>


Use git rebase to update the branches with other branches


To push your changes to Github remote repository
1.Generate ssh key
ssh-keygen
Below is the sample log when you run that command
ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/vishvaksen/.ssh/id_rsa): 
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /home/vishvaksen/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/vishvaksen/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:N0PKrbvhj6+2hPmcpSjDyLKMLnTRjGjFY0f5KbLFl88 vishvaksen@vishvaksen-Aspire-A515-51G


From that above log, copy the folder to which that key is generated
cat /home/vishvaksen/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
		
It will give that whole key and copy that key and add it in the git hub account
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCkagpEhJtYS5kLx+ojSCb1VbFyMAGC4GLooAc795H4dxCcWtixEm2M+fLuo6Y6iR1ghqCIm6hTuOgI8uMlPm5lW5YTpqLF1SVB4w2LeHrKafWu2qsu0mVORSM3Ce57mH/oig6C6BIv4RfK+CrQvulMCq/BuQ7erQjEm9PP9pZROxr0OaYscS64VdmkqhLr2nIZxnLn5amxaTLc7J/cH8bYguvhRHkZg6O5dnpf6rA3uxP5SO4W7kZVUssW5i7/Cyf2j/4botHU79boYe5C0JcDPhDPU1WGpwYs+g5Yot/9v5ZS64iwb4N0HzEZlI7hyL4W6VHq0pfPEl/H+NhO3OXB vishvaksen@vishvaksen-Aspire-A515-51G

Login into Github account->Go to Settings->SSH and GPG keys->add the key

To authenticate the GitHUb account with your local git repository after adding the ssh key,use below command
ssh -T git@github.com
