Javascript-

JavaScript is scripting language which is less than programming languuage
JavaScript is not compliled,it is interpreted
But recently, it is compliled on the fly

Advantages of using javascript are:
1.used for non programmers
2.can validate user input at client side before pushing it to the web server
3.Less server interaction
4.immediate feedback to the users
5.increase interactivity


use <script> tag in the html to embed the javascript in the html

But if you remember, we use scriptlet tag in the JSP to embed java

you can include <script> tag anywhere in the html but it is recommended use it in <head> tag



Higher order funtions:
To understand Higher order functions,we need to understand functional programming
Functional programming is programming where we can pass functions as arguments to other functions and return function from another function

In JavaScript,similar to strings,numbers,objects we treat functions as objects

whatever we can do with strings,we can do with functions

We can create anonymous function and assign it to another variable
Example:
Creating function witout a name is called anonymous function
function(x){
return x*x
}

After creating anonymous function,we can assign this to a variable
const sampleVariable=function(x){
return x*x
}

After assigning function to variable,we can pass this function to another variables also
const xxx=sampleVariable

This can be more simplified using arrow functions
const sampleVariable=(x)=>x*x

From above function,we removed all the common things using arrow function like function keyword,{},return statement
This can be applied if we have anonymous function with only one line with the return statement
