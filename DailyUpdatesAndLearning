Some Important things learned today:

1.How indexing works in Database:

Indexing is used to improve the performance while querying the data in database
In disk,database data is stored in blocks and each block contains fixed set of data

For suppose,we have 5 million records in the table and each block stores 5 records of data
Number of blocks will be 5000000/5=1 million blocks

If we have to query a record, we have to do linear seach in each block and it will take 1 million searches in the worst case scenario

To overcome this problem,we intorduce indexes on the column

If we create index on the column, then auxiliary data strctures with the indexed column and pointer to the record is created

index=column to which index need to be defined + pointer to the record

and column will be either sorted in the indexed data strcture or we create hash for each record in the indexed data strcture

As it is sorted, we can use binary search to find that record in the indexed data strctures and it will take log( 1million) which is very less compared to seach without index

Drawbacks of indexing:

For indexing we use our disk space to create that seperate data structure
and when ever we try to insert a record in the table,it will by default insert the indexed column in the seperate data structure

 
2.Cardinality and Indexing:

Cardinality of column tells how unique is the column

If we have 1000 values in a column and in that we have only 500 unique values,then the cardinality is equal to 500

low cardinality means we have less unique values for that column,so creating index on that column is useless

High cardinality will give better results if we use along with the index 


Indexing is implemented using hashing which is called hash index and B-trees
