   31  npm install nodemon

   32  nodemon
//From 33 to 64 are all the commands that are tried to install nodemon properly
   33  npm install nodemon --save
   34  nodemon
   35  ls
   36  node_modules/nodemon
   37  cd node_modules/
   38  nodemon
   39  ls
   40  lws | grep node*
   41  ls | grep node*
   42  cd nodemon/
   43  ls
   44  nodemon
   45  cd ../..
   46  npm install -g nodemon
   47  nodemon
   48  nodemon server.js
   49  npm uninstall -g nodemon
   50  npm install -g nodemon
   51  sudo chown -r $USER /usr/lib/node_modules/
   52  sudo chown -R $USER /usr/lib/node_modules/
   53  npm install -g nodemon
   54  ls -la /usr/lib/node_modules/
   55  cd /usr/lib/node_modules/
   56  ls -la
   57  ls
   58  sudo chown -R $USER /usr/lib/node_modules
   59  ls -la
   60  cd ..
   61  ls -ltr
   62  sudo npm install -g nodemon
   63  cd ~/contactlist/
   64  nodemon

From above commands,I understand one thing,whenever there is some issue in updating read only file use sudo command.This will install everything properly
sudo npm install -g nodemon
